# DbFrontend

## Project structure

For most this is a typical angular-app:

in `/app` and every descending folder/module

-   `/core`:
    -   singleton-services with a state etc. that can be used by all other components/services/pipes... that are direct or indirect children of the `core`'s parent-folder
-   `/shared`:
    -   components, pipes, directives, classes, functions, types etc. that (can) have multiple instances and can be used by all other components/services/pipes... that are direct or indirect children of the `shared`'s parent-folder
    -   to keep the size of the main-bundle small, everything (belonging in the `shared-folder`) that is used in main (app-module...) is located in the `main-shared`-folder. Nothing that is in main should import sth. directly from the `@shared`-folder
    -   some stuff is reexported by `@shared` like e.g. `@main-shared/pipes`, because e.g. `PipesModule` should also include the pipes from `MainPipesModule`.
    -   every folder in a `shared`-folder should have it's own module and should export sth. useful
-   `/feature`
    -   here are components/pipes/directives that should only be used in the `/pages`-folder at the same level <br /> **exceptions:**
    -   the top `/feature` folder should only be used in `app.component.ts`
    -   the `/shared/feature` folder should contains components that are used in multiple modules but are very specialized and will not be used on any other places
-   `/pages`:
    -   in here all all modules/components/services etc. located for the routes (-> lazy loading)
-   _lazy-loaded-pages_
    -   if there is a lazy loaded module via the router the corresponding folder with this module and all it's declarations is often at the same level as `/pages`, `shared`, `core`, etc. (e.g. `app/pages/projects/tables`). With this design the module is still at the same level as the routing says without nesting everything to much.

Between the server and the client is the cache-server (`src/cache-server`). He sends and receives requests and caches them to reduce the server load. In the best case (fallback) he is shared between all tabs through the service-worker.

The service-worker (`src/service-worker`) is used for centralized communicating between tabs.

## Build

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

### Production

-   `npm run build` builds the frontend for the cli. The build also works as a good demonstration of our capabilities.
-   `npm run build-official` builds our official cloud based website in production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
-   `npm run build-customer-on-premise` builds the website for onPremise use for a customer.
-   `npm run build-customer-online` builds the website for a customer when it should be hosted on our own server open to the internet.

-   Please provide for all `build-customer-â€¦` the correct config in `src/environments/customer/config.json` (use the `config.example.json` as an example)
    -   you can change the config easily after you already build the frontend by replacing the file in `dist/environments/customer/config.json`

### Development

-   Copy `src/environments/environments/development.example.env.ts` and rename it to `development.env.ts`. You can change all the environment variables to your liking.

-   Copy `src/proxy.conf.json.example`, rename it to `src/proxy.conf.json` and (if necessary) change the target to the url on which the db-backend is hosted. (See [here](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) for help)

-   For most development you can use `npm run serve`. A live server will be reachable under `http://localhost:4200`. The page will automatically reload after you make changes in the sourcecode. You don't have to mark the _Update on reload_-option in the browser. - It should automatically update and takeover the client. For some special cases it could still be practical (clearing cache even if service-worker didn't change).

-   With `npm run start` the project will be build in development-mode, with an active service-worker (if you enable it in the environment too), but no live-reload. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

-   When not building in production a CSP is set via the meta-attribute in the html-header. This is to prevent unpleasant surprises after the deployment with a CSP in the https-header.

## Tooling

### I18n

The frontend is internationalized. In the source-code are therefore translation-keys like `_('key.to.translation')`. With `npm run extract-i18n` the json-files under `src/assets/i18n` will be automatically updated (See [here](https://github.com/biesbjerg/ngx-translate-extract)). Don't forget to insert the translations afterwards.

### Lint

Run `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix` to automatically format and lint the whole project.

### Debugging

#### vscode

example `tasks.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Serve frontend official",
            "type": "shell",
            // use the commands specified in `package.json` as reference
            "command": "node --max_old_space_size=8192 ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng serve",
            "isBackground": true,
            "presentation": {
                "focus": true,
                "clear": true,
                "panel": "dedicated"
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "problemMatcher": {
                "owner": "typescript",
                "source": "ts",
                "applyTo": "closedDocuments",
                "fileLocation": ["relative", "${cwd}"],
                "pattern": "$tsc",
                "background": {
                    "activeOnStart": true,
                    "beginsPattern": {
                        "regexp": "(.*?)"
                    },
                    "endsPattern": {
                        "regexp": "Compiled |Failed to compile."
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

and `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "ng serve",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "Serve frontend",
            "url": "http://localhost:4200/",
            // Set to a random port that is still free
            "port": 4100,
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
                "webpack:/*": "${webRoot}/*",
                "/./*": "${webRoot}/*",
                "/src/*": "${webRoot}/*",
                "/*": "*",
                "/./~/*": "${webRoot}/node_modules/*"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Recommended extensions

#### vscode

-   Angular Language Service https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service
-   Angular Schematics
-   Debugger for Chrome

### Recommended Settings

#### vscode

Because we use `$` in variable names it is encouraged to remove `$` from the `Word separators` in the editor. Else the whole variable is not included in the default selection.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

(For everyone preferring a gui: Angular Schematics (vscode))

### Trying stuff out

[ng-run](https://ng-run.com/) is great for testing/reproducing angular/rxjs related problems (make sure that ts-strict-mode and Ivy-AOT are activated as well as all dependencies up to date).

### Analyze bundle

For analyzing the builded bundle run `npm run analyse-bundle`.

### Testing

#### Running unit tests

To run the tests [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) has to be installed.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

We currently do not have any end-to-end tests.

## Changelog

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Add the version with the appropriate metadata to the changelog-array under `src/app/shared/display-changelog/changelog.ts`
3. (Optional) add html-files with release-notes to the assets (more information in the `changelog.ts`)

## Style guide

We are mostly relying on eslint and prettier for enforcing code style.
Nevertheless there are some additional conventions:

-   Variables for injected services should have the same name as the injected service

```ts
class AComponent {
    constructor(
        private readonly serviceWorkerService: ServiceWorkerService,
        private readonly authService: AuthService,
        i18nService: I18nService
    ) {}
}
```

-   Name Observables with the postfix `$` (shortcut for `Stream`); it is allowed to not use this postfix if it doesn't improve the code -> no finnish-notation rule is enforced

```ts
const item: Item;
const items: Item[];
const item$: Observable<Item>;
const items$: Observable<Item[]>;
const item$s: Observable<Item>[];
```

-   Use the postfix `E$` (`EmitterStream`) for Subjects that should not be exposed

```ts
class AService {
    private readonly itemE$ = new ReplaySubject<Item>(1);
    public readonly item$ = this.itemE$.asObservable();
}
```

## Gotchas

-   The html of a route-component should most of the times manually be wrapped in a `<div class="page-container"></div>`. This makes it possible to make specific exceptions for e.g. a very wide table in contrast to setting the `container` class on the first level. Be aware that `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` should never be placed in a container.
-   There is a `styles-variables.ts` for CSS-values that have to be used in the JS part too.
-   All Components use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` - be aware that this ChangeDetectionStrategy gets inherited by child components. So you must programm for it too.
